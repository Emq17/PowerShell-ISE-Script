# Generating-Names-And-Creating-Users-With-PS

This PowerShell Script generates 10,000 names and users by simply alternating vowels and consonants. Keep in mind that the names will obviously sound fake or potentially offensive. If you'd like to play around and customize variables for your own use case, you can change the amount of accounts created at the top ("NUMBER_OF_ACCOUNTS_TO_CREATE) and also change the Password at ($PASSWORD_FOR_USERS). Run this inside your windows server after setting up your home lab for Active Directory.
